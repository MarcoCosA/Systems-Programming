PhotoLab performs various image processing operations on .ppm images. It provides functions to perform operations such as aging, converting to black & white, inverting colors, flipping and mirroring the image, sharpening, exchanging red and blue color channels, adding salt-and-pepper noise, and adding borders. An additional function. “CalculateCenterPixelIntensity” was added in order to efficiently calculate the new intensity for the pixels when sharpening an image. As instructed, the very edges of the sharpened image are untouched in order to keep the implementation simple.
